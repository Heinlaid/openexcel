    <p><strong>Effective Date: February&nbsp;2026</strong></p>

    <h2>1&nbsp;· Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Open&nbsp;Excel Chrome extension (the “Service”),
      provided by OÜ&nbsp;ValmisLab (“we”, “us”, “our”).
    </p>

    <h2>2&nbsp;· Acceptance</h2>
    <p>
      By installing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>3&nbsp;· Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      Open&nbsp;Excel allows you to open and view Excel files (<code>.xls</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>) in Chrome.
      The Service includes features such as multi-sheet navigation, printing, and downloading/exporting.
      After sign-in, the Service can enable local editing and local saving (on your device).
      Optionally, you may export a file to Google Sheets, which uploads the file to your own Google Drive and opens it in Google Sheets.
    </p>

    <h2>4&nbsp;· Local Processing, Storage, and User Content</h2>
    <p>
      By default, Excel files are processed locally in your browser. You are responsible for the files you open, edit, and export,
      and for ensuring you have the rights to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To provide “Recent files” and local saving, the Service may store file data locally in your browser (e.g., IndexedDB) and store settings/session
      information in <code>chrome.storage.local</code>. You can remove items from Recent or clear Recent, which removes associated cached data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service may attempt compatibility repairs for certain non-standard Excel files (e.g., metadata/styles adjustments)
      to improve import reliability. Formatting or features (such as images/external links) may not be preserved in all cases.
    </p>

    <h2>5&nbsp;· Account, Authentication, and Email OTP</h2>
    <p>
      Some features (such as local editing and local saving) may require you to sign in.
      Sign-in options may include Google sign-in and Email OTP (one-time code).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose Email OTP, you authorize us to send an authentication code to the email address you provide.
      Marketing emails are optional and only sent if you explicitly opt in.
    </p>

    <h2>6&nbsp;· Google OAuth, Google APIs, and Scopes</h2>
    <p>
      If you choose Google sign-in or use Google Sheets export, the Service may request Google OAuth authorization.
      The Service requests only the permissions/scopes necessary for the specific action you choose.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>userinfo.email</code> — used for Google sign-in to retrieve your email address.</li>
      <li>
        <code>drive.file</code> — requested only when you click “Edit&nbsp;in&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Sheets” to upload the chosen file
        to your Google Drive and convert/open it as a Google Sheets file.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Google API Disclosure.</strong>
      Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will comply with the
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Google API Services User Data Policy
      </a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>7&nbsp;· Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Service may interact with third-party services to provide functionality you request, such as Google OAuth/Google Drive/Google Sheets,
      and an authentication backend endpoint (<code>api.openexcel.org</code>) for session management and Email OTP verification.
      Your use of third-party services may be subject to their respective terms and policies.
    </p>

    <h2>8&nbsp;· User Rights</h2>
    <p>
      We grant you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to use the Service for personal or internal business purposes,
      subject to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>9&nbsp;· Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p>
      You may not reverse-engineer, redistribute, or use the Service to violate any law, infringe third-party rights,
      or attempt to bypass security or access controls. You may not use the Service to send abuse traffic (e.g., OTP spam) or interfere with the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>10&nbsp;· Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All code, trademarks, and logos remain the property of OÜ&nbsp;ValmisLab (or its licensors).
      No rights are transferred to you except as expressly stated in these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11&nbsp;· Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.
      We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that file imports/exports will preserve all formatting in all cases.
    </p>

    <h2>12&nbsp;· Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, OÜ&nbsp;ValmisLab shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
      consequential, or exemplary damages arising from or related to your use of the Service, including loss of data, profits, or business interruption.
    </p>

    <h2>13&nbsp;· Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you breach these Terms or misuse the Service.
      You may stop using the Service at any time by uninstalling the extension.
    </p>

    <h2>14&nbsp;· Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of the Service is also subject to our Privacy Policy. Please review it at
      <a href="privacy.html">privacy.html</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>15&nbsp;· Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of Estonia. Disputes will be resolved in Harju County Court, Tallinn.
    </p>

    <h2>16&nbsp;· Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
      Updates will be posted with a revised effective date.
