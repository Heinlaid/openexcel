    <p><strong>Effective Date: February 2026</strong></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Open Excel</strong> is a Chrome extension that lets you open and view Excel files (<code>.xls</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>) directly in Chrome.
      You can print, download the file, and (after sign-in) edit and locally save changes.
      Optionally, you can export a file to Google Sheets for editing in your Google account.
      We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how data is handled.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
      By default, all file processing occurs locally in your browser. <strong>Excel file contents are not sent to our servers</strong>.
      File content leaves your device only if you explicitly choose to upload it to Google Drive via the
      “Edit in Google Sheets” button.
    </p>

    <h3>Local storage on your device</h3>
    <p>To provide core features, Open Excel stores some data locally in your browser:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Excel file bytes</strong> are stored in the browser’s <strong>IndexedDB</strong> to support “Recent files” and local saving.</li>
      <li><strong>Recent files list</strong> (metadata like file name and internal file id) and <strong>settings</strong> (e.g., open as tab/popup) are stored in <code>chrome.storage.local</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Session state</strong> (to keep you signed in for editing) is stored in <code>chrome.storage.local</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can remove individual recent items or clear the recent list, which also removes associated cached file data.
    </p>

    <h2>Account &amp; Authentication (api.openexcel.org)</h2>
    <p>
      To enable editing (and local saving), Open Excel offers sign-in methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google sign-in</strong> (via Chrome Identity / OAuth)</li>
      <li><strong>Email OTP</strong> (a one-time code sent to your email)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you sign in, we process minimal data needed for authentication and security:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> (identifier)</li>
      <li><strong>Auth provider</strong> (Google or Email)</li>
      <li><strong>Optional marketing consent</strong> (only if you choose it)</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy policy version</strong> (to record which version you accepted)</li>
      <li><strong>UI language</strong> (to improve your experience)</li>
      <li><strong>Basic security signals</strong> such as IP address and user agent (used for abuse prevention like OTP rate-limiting)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> upload Excel file contents to our servers as part of sign-in.
    </p>

    <h2>Google Sheets (optional)</h2>
    <p>
      If you click <strong>“Edit in Google Sheets”</strong>, the extension exports the current workbook and uploads it to <strong>your Google Drive</strong>,
      converts it to a Google Sheets file (in your account), and opens it on <code>docs.google.com</code>.
      This upload happens only when you explicitly use this feature.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requests the following Chrome permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>storage</strong> — store local settings, session state, and recent file metadata; and support local saving via cached workbook bytes in IndexedDB.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>identity</strong> — authenticate with Google when you sign in with Google and/or export to Google Sheets.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The extension also uses host permissions to access:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>https://accounts.google.com/*</strong> — Google OAuth sign-in flow</li>
      <li><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/*</strong> — Google APIs (email/user info for sign-in; Drive API for upload when using Google Sheets export)</li>
      <li><strong>https://docs.google.com/*</strong> — open the exported spreadsheet in Google Sheets</li>
      <li><strong>https://api.openexcel.org/*</strong> — authentication backend (Email OTP and session)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Google OAuth scopes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>userinfo.email</strong> — used for Google sign-in to retrieve your email address.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>drive.file</strong> — requested <strong>only when you click “Edit in Google Sheets”</strong>.
        This scope is limited to files you create or select with the app and does not provide access to your entire Google Drive.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local cached files / recent list:</strong> stored locally to support Recent and local save; you can remove items or clear the list at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>OTP codes:</strong> expire after a short time and are used only to complete sign-in.</li>
      <li><strong>Sessions:</strong> expire after a limited period; you can log out to clear local session data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Remote Code</h2>
    <p>
      The extension ships with all required assets and does not execute remote code.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Updates will be posted here with a revised effective date.
