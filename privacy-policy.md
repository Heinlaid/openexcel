Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 12/03/2025

1. Introduction
Thank you for choosing Open Excel (“the Extension”). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any information collected or processed through the Extension.

2. Data Collection and Usage
Local-Only File Processing: The Extension processes Excel files (.xls, .xlsx) locally in your browser. The data does not leave your device.
No Personal Data Collection: We do not collect, store, or share personal information such as names, email addresses, or browsing history.
Temporary Storage Permission: We use Chrome’s local storage to temporarily store file data to display the spreadsheet. The data is removed once you close the tab or load a new file.
Tabs Permission: We use this permission to open and manage new tabs for an enhanced viewing experience. We do not read or store your browsing history.
3. Third-Party Services
SheetJS Library: The Extension uses the open-source library xlsx.full.min.js locally packaged within the Extension. This library does not transmit user data to external services.
No Remote Code Execution: All scripts and resources are bundled with the Extension. We do not load or inject code from external URLs.
4. Disclosure of Information
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer user data to third parties.
We do not share user data with any external service or advertising platform.
5. Data Security
Since data is processed locally on your device, your files remain private.
We adhere to Google Chrome’s content security policies to ensure data safety.
6. Your Choices
Uninstallation: You can remove the Extension at any time from Chrome. Once removed, we no longer have access to local storage or permission to open tabs on your device.
7. Compliance with Laws
We comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding data protection and privacy, including the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last Updated” date.
